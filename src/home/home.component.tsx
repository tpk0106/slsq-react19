            This is the official website of the Sri Lanka Society of Queensland Incorporated. While
            Sri Lanka, jewel of the Indian Ocean, may be far from where we live, it shall always be
            in our hearts as a land of rich rainforests, bountiful tea plantations and endless
            beaches. This website serves as virtual point of reference to the Society and all its
            activities as well as a portal to upcoming events and community announcements. <br />
